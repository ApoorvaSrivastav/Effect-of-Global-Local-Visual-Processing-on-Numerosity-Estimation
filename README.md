# Effect-of-Global-Local-Visual-Processing-on-Numerosity-Estimation
This is a project carried out under Cognitive Science Course. The aim of the project is to study the methodology of estimation used by humans and how that is affected by whether they see objects Globally or Locally. We used Psychtoolbox in MATLAB to design the experiment. We conducted the experiment on 25 human subjects in the age range 20-28 years. 

Null Hypothesis: Global/Local Processing has no effect on the accuracy of the Numerosity Estimation and Reaction Time.

Alternate Hypothesis: Global/Local Processing has differential effect  on the accuracy of the Numerosity Estimation and Reaction Time.
